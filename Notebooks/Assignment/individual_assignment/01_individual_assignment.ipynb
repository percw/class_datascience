    "This notebook contains the individual assignment for the class MGT-499 Statistics and Data Science. Important information:\n",
    "- **Content**: the assignment is divided in two main parts, namely data cleaning (2 datasets) and Exploratory Data Analysis, for a total of 13 main questions (see table of contents). Some of these main questions are divided in sub questions. In the first part, the questions are very specific, while in the second part they are more open.\n",
    "- **Deadline**: Tuesday 8th of November at 23:59. \n",
    "- **Final Output**: a Jupyter notebook, which we (teachers) can run. \n",
    "- **Answering the Questions**: you will find the questions in markdown cells below. Under each of these cells, you will find a cell / cells for answers. Type there your answer. For the answer to be correct, the cell with the answer must run without error (unless specified). You can use markdown cells for the answers that require text.\n",
    "- **Submission**: submit the assignment on Moodle, under [Individual Assignment](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1222846)"

    "In this section you will define a research question and perform a preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to address - or better, start addressing - the question at hand. This exercise will be done along the lines of the analysis done by our own Quentin Gallea in \"*A recipe to empirically answer any question quickly*\" ([Towards Data Science, 2022](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-recipe-to-empirically-answer-any-question-quickly-22e48c867dd5)). In this article, Quentin shows the first steps of an EDA that aims to explore whether heat waves have pushed governments to implement regulations against climate change (causal link). The logic is that, as it gets hotter and hotter, governments become more aware of climate change, and the problems it can cause to society, and start addressing it. In Quentin's analysis, heat waves (proxied by temperature) is the \"main explanatory variable\", rainfall is the \"explanatory variable for heterogeneity\", and regulations against climate change (proxied by the Environmental Policy Stringency Index) is the \"outcome variable\". He finds that indeed countries with relatively high temperatures have implemented more regulations against climate change. This is true especially when rainfall levels are low, as when it does not rain the damage of extreme heat is more evident to legislators, who therefore apply stricter regulations against these phenomenons.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be asked to do a similar analysis on a research question of your choice, using at least two of the variables of the dataset we have created in the former questions (QOG + Polity). For example, \"what is the average temperature in 2010?\" is not a valid research question (univariate), while \"what is the impact of high temperatures on the stringency of climate regulations?\" is a valid research question (at least bivariate). As before, we will ask you some (this time more general and open) questions, and you should report your answer in the cells below each question. Use a mix of markdown and code cells to answer (markdown for text and code for graphs and tables). We should be able to run all the graphs, i.e. screenshots of graphs are not accepted. Note that for now we have put only one markdown cell and one code cell for the answer, but feel free to add as many cells as you need.\n",
